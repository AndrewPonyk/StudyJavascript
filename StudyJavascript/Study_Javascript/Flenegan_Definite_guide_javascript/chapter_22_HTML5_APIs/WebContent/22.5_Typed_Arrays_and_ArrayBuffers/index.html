			Typed Arrays, &lt;canvas>, and Core JavaScript
		Typed arrays are an essential part of the WebGL 3D graphics API for the &lt;canvas>
		element, and browsers have implemented them as part of WebGL. WebGL is not cov-
		ered in this book, but typed arrays are generally useful and are covered here. You may
		recall from Chapter 21 that the Canvas API defines a getImageData() method that re-
		turns an ImageData object. The data property of an ImageData is an array of bytes. The
		HTML standard calls this a CanvasPixelArray, but it is essentially the same as the
		Uint8Array described here, except for the way it handles values outside of the range 0
		to 255.
		Note that these types are not part of the core language. A future version of the JavaScript
		language is likely to include support for typed arrays like these, but at the time of this
		writing, it is unclear whether the language will adopt the API described here or will
		create a new API.

				Typed arrays are array-like objects (§7.11) that differ from regular arrays in some
		important ways:
		• The elements of a typed array are all numbers. The constructor used to create the
		typed array determines the type (signed or unsigned integers or floating point) and
		size (in bits) of the numbers.
		• Typed arrays have a fixed length.
		• The elements of a typed array are always initialized to 0 when the array is created.
	</pre>
	<hr>
	<pre>
				There are eight kinds of typed arrays, each with a different element type. You can create
		them with the following constructors:
		Constructor Numeric type
		Int8Array() signed bytes
		Uint8Array() unsigned bytes
		Int16Array() signed 16-bit short integers
		Uint16Array() unsigned 16-bit short integers
		Int32Array() signed 32-bit integers
		Uint32Array() unsigned 32-bit integers
		Float32Array() 32-bit floating-point value
		Float64Array() 64-bit floating-point value: a regular JavaScript number

		var bytes = new Uint8Array(1024);       // One kilobyte of bytes
for(var i = 0; i < bytes.length; i++)   // For each element of the array
    bytes[i] = i & 0xFF;                // Set it to the low 8 bits of index
var copy = new Uint8Array(bytes);       // Make a copy of the array
var ints = new Int32Array([0,1,2,3]);   // A typed array holding these 4 ints
	</pre>

		JavaScript square-bracket notation allows you to get and set individual elements
typed array. But typed arrays also define methods for setting and querying entire reg
of the array. The set() method copies the elements of regular or typed arrays in
typed array:
var bytes = new Uint8Array(1024)         // A 1K buffer
var pattern = new Uint8Array([0,1,2,3]); // An array of 4 bytes
bytes.set(pattern);      // Copy them to the start of another byte array
bytes.set(pattern, 4);   // Copy them again at a different offset
bytes.set([0,1,2,3], 8); // Or just copy values direct from a regular array
	
	</pre>
	<hr>
	<pre>
		The fact that the subarray() method returns a new view of an existing array reveals
something important about typed arrays: they are all views on an underlying chunk of
bytes known as an ArrayBuffer. Every typed array has three properties that relate to the
underlying buffer:
last3.buffer                // => returns an ArrayBuffer object
last3.buffer == ints.buffer // => true: both are views of the same buffer
last3.byteOffset            // => 14: this view starts at byte 14 of the buffer
last3.byteLength            // => 6: this view is 6 bytes (3 16-bit ints) long

		Typed arrays allow you to view the same sequence of bytes in chunks of 8, 16, 32, or
64 bits. This exposes the “endianness”: the order in which bytes are arranged into longer
words. For efficiency, typed arrays use the native endianness of the underlying hard-
ware. On little-endian systems, the bytes of a number are arranged in an ArrayBuffer
from least significant to most significant. On big-endian platforms, the bytes are ar-
ranged from most significant to least significant. You can determine the endianness of
the underlying platform with code like this:
// If the integer 0x00000001 is arranged in memory as 01 00 00 00, then
// we're on a little endian platform. On a big-endian platform we'd get
// get bytes 00 00 00 01 instead.
var little_endian = new Int8Array(new Int32Array([1]).buffer)[0] === 1;

		var typedInt32=new Int32Array(10);
		typedInt32[8]=10;
		//there is also method set
		
		
		
		typedInt32.buffer[0]=100;
		typedInt32.buffer[1]=1; // now typedInt32[0] equals 356 , int32 use 4 bytes 
	</pre>
	<hr>
	<pre>
		<h2>ArrayBuffer - buffer for bytes , ant it can be a base for array</h2>
		var buffer=new ArrayBuffer(22);
		var intonbuffer=new Float64Array(buffer);
		alert(intonbuffer.length); // 2 - because in 22 bytes we can allocate only 2 Float64

		<b>DataView </b> class, which defines methods for reading and writing values
from an ArrayBuffer with explicitly specified byte ordering:
var data;                     // Assume this is an ArrayBuffer from the network
var view = DataView(data);    // Create a view of it
var int = view.getInt32(0);   // Big-endian 32-bit signed int from byte 0
int = view.getInt32(4,false); // Next 32-bit int is also big-endian
int = view.getInt32(8,true)   // Next 4 bytes as a little-endian signed int
view.setInt32(8,int,false);   // Write it back in big-endian format
DataView defines eight get methods for each of the eight typed array formats. They
have names like getInt16(), getUint32(), and getFloat64(). The first argument is the
byte offset within the ArrayBuffer at which the value begins. All of these getter methods,
other than getInt8() and getUint8(), accept an optional boolean value as their second
argument. If the second argument is omitted or is false, big-endian byte ordering is
used. If the second argument is true, little-endian ordering is used.
DataView defines eight corresponding set methods that write values into the under-lying ArrayBuffer. The first argument is the offset at which the value begins. The second
argument  is  the  value  to  write.
