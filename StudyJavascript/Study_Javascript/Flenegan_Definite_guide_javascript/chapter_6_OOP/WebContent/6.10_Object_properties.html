		Object Methods
As discussed earlier, all JavaScript objects (except those explicitly created without a
prototype) inherit properties from  Object.prototype. These inherited properties are
primarily methods, and because they are universally available, they are of particular
interest to JavaScript programmers. We’ve already seen the  hasOwnProperty(),
propertyIsEnumerable(), and  isPrototypeOf()methods. (And we’ve also already cov-ered quite a few static functions defined on the  Objectconstructor, such as
Object.create()and  Object.getPrototypeOf().) This section explains a handful of uni-versal object methods that are defined on Object.prototype, but which are intended to
be overridden by other, more specialized classes.

6.10.1 The toString() Method
The  toString()method takes no arguments; it returns a string that somehow represents
the value of the object on which it is invoked. JavaScript invokes this method of an
object whenever it needs to convert the object to a string. This occurs, for example,
when you use the +operator to concatenate a string with an object or when you pass
an object to a method that expects a string.
The default toString()method is not very informative (though it is useful for deter-mining the class of an object, as we saw in §6.8.2). For example, the following line of
code simply evaluates to the string “[object Object]”:
var s = { x:1, y:1 }.toString();
Because this default method does not display much useful information, many classes
define their own versions of toString(). For example, when an array is converted to a
string, you obtain a list of the array elements, themselves each converted to a string,
and when a function is converted to a string, you obtain the source code for the function.
These customized versions of the toString()method are documented in the reference
section. See  Array.toString(),  Date.toString(), and  Function.toString(), for
example.
§9.6.3describes how to define a custom toString()method for your own classes.

6.10.2 The toLocaleString() Method
In addition to the basic toString()method, objects all have a toLocaleString(). The
purpose of this method is to return a localized string representation of the object. The
default toLocaleString()method defined by Object doesn’t do any localization itself:
it simply calls toString()and returns that value. The Date and Number classes define
customized versions of toLocaleString()that attempt to format numbers, dates, and
times according to local conventions. Array defines a  toLocaleString()method that
works like toString()except that it formats array elements by calling their  toLocale
String()methods instead of their toString()methods.

6.10.3 The toJSON() Method
Object.prototypedoes not actually define a  toJSON()method, but the
JSON.stringify()method (see §6.9) looks for a  toJSON()method on any object it is
asked to serialize. If this method exists on the object to be serialized, it is invoked, and
the return value is serialized, instead of the original object. See  Date.toJSON()for an
example.

6.10.4 The valueOf() Method
The valueOf() method is much like the toString()method, but it is called when Java-Script needs to convert an object to some primitive type other than a string—typically,
a number. JavaScript calls this method automatically if an object is used in a context
where a primitive value is required. The default valueOf()method does nothing inter-esting, but some of the built-in classes define their own  valueOf()method (see
Date.valueOf(), for example).  §9.6.3explains how to define a  valueOf()method for
custom object types you define*/
