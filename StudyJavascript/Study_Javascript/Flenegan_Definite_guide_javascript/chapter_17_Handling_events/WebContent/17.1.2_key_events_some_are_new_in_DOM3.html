		<h3>Theory</h3>
		<h4>keydown,keyup and keypress events</h4>
		The <b>keydown</b> and <b>keyup</b> events are low-level keyboard events: they are triggered when-ever a key (even a modifier key) is pressed or released. When a keydown event generates
		a printable character, an additional keypress event is triggered after the keydown but
		before the keyup. (In the case of a key that is held down until it repeats, there may be
		many keypress events before the keyup event.) The <b>keypress</b> event is a higher-level text
		event, and its event object specifies the character that was generated, not the key that
		was pressed

			 DOM Events
		The DOM Level 3 Events specification has been under development by the W3C for
		about a decade. At the time of this writing, it has undergone substantial revision to
		bring it in line with current browser reality and it is finally in the “last call working
		draft” stage of standardization. It standardizes many of the legacy events described
		above and adds some new ones described here. These new event types are not yet widely
		supported, but browser vendors are expected to implement them once the standard
		is final.
		As noted above, the DOM Level 3 Events specification standardizes the focusin and
		focusout events as bubbling alternatives to the focus and blur events and standardizes
		the mouseenter and mouseleave events as nonbubbling alternatives to mouseover and
		mouseout. This version of the standard also deprecates a number of event types that
		were defined by Level 2 but never widely implemented. Browsers are still allowed to
		generate events like DOMActivate, DOMFocusIn, and DOMNodeInserted, but these
		are no longer required, and they are not documented in this book.
		3
		What is new in the DOM Level 3 Events specification is standardized support for two-dimensional mouse wheels via the wheel event and better support for text input events
		with a textinput event and with a new KeyboardEvent object that is passed as the
		argument to handlers for keydown, keyup, and keypress events
		A handler for a wheel event receives an event object with all the usual mouse event
		properties, and also deltaX, deltaY, and deltaZ properties that report rotation around
		three different mouse wheel axes. (Most mouse wheels are one or two dimensional and
		do not use deltaZ.) See §17.6 for more on mousewheel events

			How to register:
In HTML: 
This event cannot be registered in HTML.

In JavaScript: 
object.addEventListener ("textInput", handler, useCapture);</pre>
		</div>
		DOM Level 3 Events defines the keypress event described above, but deprecates it in
favor of a new event named textinput. Rather than a hard-to-use numeric keyCode value,
the event object passed to a textinput event handler has a data property that specifies
the string of text that was entered. The textinput event is not a keyboard-specific event:
it is triggered whenever text input occurs, whether via the keyboard, cut-and-paste,
drag-and-drop, and so on. The specification defines an inputMethod property on the
event object and a set of constants representing different kinds of text input (keyboard,
paste or drop, handwriting or voice recognition, and so on). At the time of this writing,
Safari  and  Chrome  support  a  version  of  this  event  using  the  mixed-case  name
textInput. Its event object includes the data property but not the inputMethod property.
§17.8 includes an example that makes use of this textInput event.
