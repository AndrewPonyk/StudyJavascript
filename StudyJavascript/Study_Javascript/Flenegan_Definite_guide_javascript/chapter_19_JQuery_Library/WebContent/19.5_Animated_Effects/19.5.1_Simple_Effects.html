		jQuery defines nine simple effects methods to hide and show elements. They can be
divided into three groups based on the kind of effect they perform:
	</h5>
	<pre>
				fadeIn(), fadeOut(), fadeTo()
		These are the simplest effects: fadeIn() and fadeOut() simply animate the CSS
		opacity property to show or hide an element. Both accept optional duration and
		callback arguments. fadeTo() is slightly different: it expects a target opacity argu-
		ment and animates the change from the element’s current opacity to this target.
		For the fadeTo() method, the duration (or options object) is required as the first
		argument and the target opacity is required as the second argument. The callback
		function is an optional third argument.
	
			show(), hide(), toggle()
		The fadeOut() method listed above makes elements invisible but retains space for
		them in the document layout. The hide() method, by contrast, removes the ele-
		ments from the layout as if the CSS display property was set to none. When invoked
		with no arguments, hide() and show() simply hide or show the selected elements
		immediately. With a duration (or options object) argument, however, they animate
		the hiding or showing process. hide() shrinks an element’s width and height to 0
		at the same time that it reduces the element’s opacity to 0. show() reverses the
		process.
		toggle() changes the visibility state of the elements it is invoked on: if they are
		hidden, it calls show(), and if they are visible, it calls hide(). As with show() and
		hide(), you must pass a duration or options object to toggle() to get an animated
		effect. Passing true to toggle() is the same as calling show() with no arguments
		and passing false is the same as calling hide() with no arguments. Note also that
		if you pass two or more function arguments to toggle() it registers event handlers,
		as described in §19.4.1.
		
				slideDown(), slideUp(), slideToggle()
		slideUp() hides the elements in the jQuery object by animating their height to 0
		and then setting the CSS display property to “none”. slideDown() reverses the
		process to make a hidden element visible again. slideToggle() toggles the visibility
		of an item using a slide up or slide down animation. Each of the three methods
		accepts  the  optional  duration  and  callback  arguments  (or  the  options  object
		argument).
	</pre>

	<script type="text/javascript">
	
	// we must set duration in show() method !!!!!!!!!
		$("h5").fadeOut().fadeIn().hide("slow").show("slow");
	
	
		alert("end");
	</script>
