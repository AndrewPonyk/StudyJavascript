		<h3>19.8.2  Selection Methods</h3>
		
		<pre>
			In addition to the selector grammar supported by $(), jQuery defines a number of
selection methods. Most of the jQuery methods we’ve seen so far in this chapter per-
form some action on the selected elements. The selection methods are different: they
alter the set of selected elements by refining it, augmenting it, or just using it as a starting
point for a new selection.
This section describes these selection methods. You’ll notice that many of the methods
provide the same functionality as the selector grammar itself.
The simplest way to refine a selection is by position within the selection. first() returns
a jQuery object that contains only the first selected element, and last() returns a jQuery
object that contains only the last element. More generally, the  <b>eq()</b> method returns a
jQuery object that contains only the single selected element at the specified index. (In
jQuery 1.4, negative indexes are allowed and count from the end of the selection.) Note
that these methods return a jQuery object with a single element. This is different than
regular array indexing, which returns a single element with no jQuery object wrapped
around it:
		
		<br>
		var paras = $("p");
paras.first()         // Select only the first <p> element
paras.last()          // Select only the last <p>
paras.eq(1)           // Select the second <p>
paras.eq(-2)          // Select the second to last <p>
paras[1]              // The second <p> element, itself
<hr>
$("p").slice(2,5)      // Select the 3rd, 4th, and 5th <p> elements
$("div").slice(-3)     // The last three <div> elements
		</pre>

		filter() is a general-purpose selection filtering method, and you can invoke it in three
different ways:
• If you pass a selector string to filter(), it returns a jQuery object containing only
those selected elements that also match that selector.
• If you pass another jQuery object to filter(), it returns a new jQuery object that
contains the intersection of the two jQuery objects. You can also pass an array of
elements, or even a single document element, to filter().
• If you pass a predicate function to filter(), that function is called for each matched
element, and filter() returns a jQuery object containing only those elements for
which the predicate returned true (or any truthy value). The predicate function is
called with the element as its this value and the element index as an argument.
(See also jQuery.grep() in §19.7.)
$("div").filter(".note")                            // Same as $("div.note")
$("div").filter($(".note"))                         // Same as $("div.note")
$("div").filter(function(idx) { return idx%2==0 })  // Same as $("div:even")
