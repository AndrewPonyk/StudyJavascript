		19.4.4  Advanced Event Handler Registration
	Weâ€™ve seen that jQuery defines quite a few simple methods for registering event han-
	dlers. Each of these simply invoke the single, more complex method bind() to bind a
	handler for a named event type to each of the elements in the jQuery object. Using
	bind() directly allows you to use advanced event registration features that are not
	available through the simpler methods.
	4
	In its simplest form, bind() expects an event type string as its first argument and an
	event handler function as its second. The simple event registration methods use this
	form of bind(). The call $('p').click(f), for example, is equivalent to:
	$('p').bind('click', f);

	<script type="text/javascript">
		
		$("div").bind("mouseover mouseleave",function(){
			alert("event binded");

		var button1=$("#button1");
		
		button1.bind("customEvent",function(){
			alert("custom event");
		})
		
		button1.trigger("customEvent");
		
		alert("end");
