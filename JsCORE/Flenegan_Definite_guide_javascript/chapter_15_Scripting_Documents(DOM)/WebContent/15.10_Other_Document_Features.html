		also define a few other properties of interest:
		cookie
		A special property that allows JavaScript programs to read and write HTTP cook-ies. This property is covered in Chapter 20.
		domain
		A property that allows mutually trusted web servers within the same Internet
		domain to collaboratively relax same-origin policy security restrictions on inter-actions between their web pages (see §13.6.2.1).
		lastModified
		A string that contains the modification date of the document.
		location
		This property refers to the same Location object as the location property of the
		Window object.
		referrer
		The URL of the document containing the link, if any, that brought the browser to
		the current document. This property has the same content as the HTTP Referer
		header, but it is spelled with a double r.
		title
		The text between the &lt;title> and &lt;/title> tags for this document.
		URL
		The URL of the document as a read-only String rather than as a Location object.
		The value of this property is the same as the initial value of location.href, but it
		is not dynamic like the Location object is. If the user navigates to a new fragment
		identifier  within  the  document,  for  example,  location.href  will  change,  but
		document.URL will not.
		<b>referrer</b> is one of the most interesting of these properties: it contains the URL of the
		document from which the user linked to the current document. You might use this
		property with code like this:

	<h2>The document.write() Method	</h2>
	<pre>
		
			It is important to understand that you can use the write() method to output HTML to
		the current document only while that document is being parsed. That is, you can call
		document.write() from within top-level code in &lt;script> elements only because these
		scripts  are  executed  as  part  of  the  document  parsing  process.  If  you  place  a
		document.write() call within a function definition and then call that function from an
		event handler, it will not work as you expect—in fact, it will erase the current document
		and the scripts it contains! (You’ll see why shortly.) For similar reasons, you should
		not use document.write() in scripts that have the defer or async attributes set.

	<h2>15.10.3  Querying Selected Text</h2>
	<pre>
		It is sometimes useful to be able to determine what text the user has selected within a
		document. You can do that with a function like this:
		
			function getSelectedText() {
		    if (window.getSelection)       // The HTML5 standard API
		        return window.getSelection().toString();
		    else if (document.selection)   // This is the IE-specific technique.
		        return document.selection.createRange().text;
		}
	</pre>
	
	
	<script type="text/javascript">
		
	function getSelectedText() {
	    if (window.getSelection)       // The HTML5 standard API
	        return window.getSelection().toString();
	    else if (document.selection)   // This is the IE-specific technique.
	        return document.selection.createRange().text;
	}
	function CopyToClipboard(text) {
	    Copied = text.createTextRange();
	    Copied.execCommand("Copy");
	    alert('copied');
	}
	
	alert("document.referred="+document.referrer); 
		
		alert('end');
	</script>
	
	<button onclick="CopyToClipboard(getSelectedText());">Copy Selected Text to Clipboard</button>
