	<h3>attr - method</h3>
	<h4>to set or get attributes</h4>
	<div>
		<pre>
				Some of the simplest, and most common, operations on jQuery objects are those that
			get or set the value of HTML attributes, CSS styles, element content, or element
			geometry. This section describes those methods. First, however, it is worth making
			some generalizations about getter and setter methods in jQuery:
			• Rather than defining a pair of methods, jQuery uses a single method as both getter
			and setter. If you pass a new value to the method, it sets that value; if you don’t
			specify a value, it returns the current value.
			• When used as setters, these methods set values on every element in the jQuery
			object, and then return the jQuery object to allow method chaining.
			• When used as getters, these methods query only the first element of the set of
			elements and return a single value. (Use map()if you want to query all elements.)
			Since getters do not return the jQuery object they are invoked on, they can only
			appear at the end of a method chain.
			• When used as setters, these methods often accept object arguments. In this case,
			each property of the object specifies a name and a value to be set.
			• When used as setters, these methods often accept functions as values. In this case,
			the function is invoked to compute the value to be set. The element that the value
			is being computed for is the  thisvalue, the element index is passed as the first
			argument to the function, and the current value is passed as the second argument.
