		<h2>4 ways to use jQuery </h2>
		
				The jQuery()function (a.k.a. $()) is the most important one in the jQuery library. It is
		heavily overloaded, however, and there are four different ways you can invoke it.
		
				The<b> first </b>, and most common, way to invoke $()is to pass a CSS selector (a string) to
		it. When called this way, it returns the set of elements from the current document that
		match the selector. jQuery supports most of the CSS3 selector syntax, plus some ex-tensions of its own. Complete details of the jQuery selector syntax are in  ยง19.8.1. If
		3. When this chapter was written, the current version of jQuery was 1.4.2. As the book goes to press,
		jQuery 1.5 has just been released. The changes in jQuery 1.5 mostly involve the Ajax utility function,
		and they will be mentioned in passing in ยง19.6.
		19.1 jQuery Basics | 525
		Client-Side
		JavaScript
		you pass an element or a jQuery object as the second argument to $(), it returns only
		matching descendants of the specified element or elements. This optional second ar-gument value defines the starting point (or points) for the query and is often called the
		context.
		
		The<b> second </b>way to invoke $()is to pass it an Element or Document or Window object.
		Called like this, it simply wraps the element, document, or window in a jQuery object
		and returns that object. Doing this allows you to use jQuery methods to manipulate
		the element rather than using raw DOM methods. It is common to see jQuery programs
		call $(document)or $(this), for example. jQuery objects can represent more than one
		element in a document, and you can also pass an array of elements to $(). In this case,
		the returned jQuery object represents the set of elements in your array.
		
		The<b> third</b> way to invoke  $()is to pass it a string of HTML text. When you do this,
		jQuery creates the HTML element or elements described by that text and then returns
		a jQuery object representing those elements. jQuery does not automatically insert the
		newly created elements into the document, but the jQuery methods described in
		ยง19.3allow you to easily insert them where you want them. Note that you cannot pass
		plain text when you invoke $()in this way, or jQuery will think you are passing a CSS
		selector. For this style of invocation, the string you pass to  $()must include at least
		one HTML tag with angle brackets.
				var img = $("<img/>", // Create a new <img> element
		{ src:url, // with this HTML attribute,
		css: {borderWidth:5}, // this CSS style,
		click: handleClick // and this event handler.
		});
		
		
				Finally, the<b> fourth</b> way to invoke  $()is to pass a function to it. If you do this, the function
		you pass will be invoked when the document has been loaded and the DOM is ready
		to be manipulated. This is the jQuery version of the  onLoad()function from  Exam-ple 13-5. It is very common to see jQuery programs written as anonymous functions
		defined within a call to jQuery():
		jQuery(function() { // Invoked when the document has loaded
		// All jQuery code goes here
		});

		alert(divs.length);// we can also use divs.size()
		
		/* divs.each(function(){ // alert id of each element
			
			alert(this.innerHTML);
		});
 */		
 
 		var ids=divs.map(function(){return this.id;}).toArray().sort();
 
 		alert(ids[0]+","+ids[1]);
 
 		$(window).scroll(function(e){ // when window is scrolling
 		
 			console.log($(this).scrollTop()); /// $(this) !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! -selector
 			
 			
 		});
		alert("end");
